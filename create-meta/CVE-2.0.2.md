reading `Meta` message in a report

### Suggested description of the vulnerability for use in the CVE:

`create-meta` creates a `Meta` protobuf message which describes the execution context of a Cucumber run. It provides information about the system where the tests were executed and which Git repository are being tested.
In some cases, the GIT remote contains credentials (eg: `https://login@password:example.com/git/my_repo.git`) and those credentials were included in the `Meta` message, making it public to anyone who could access the messages (for examples once they have been uploaded to reports.cucumber.io)
